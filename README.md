The best time to initiate a crowd funding campaign was the summer months. There is a steep incline in success rates starting in May and tapering off until September. Winter months were the least successful periods. ![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98677283/158027310-ed1c7822-5a47-45f6-9dd8-9d49cfeb6ea4.png)
